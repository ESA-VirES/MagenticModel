World Magnetic Model 2010 - CLI Tools
=====================================

These are the original NOAA WMM 2010 CLI command line utilities and 
the WMM 2010 mode itself (WMM.COF).  The tools require the Geomagnetism 
shared library to be installed. The technical documentation is not 
included and can be obtained with the original WMM package:

  http://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/geomag/WMM/soft.shtml

The code selection and preparation of the makefile was done by
EOX IT Services GmbH, Vienna, Austria in October 2014.

To build the executables run:

  $ make build


ABSTRACT

The purpose of Geomagnetism Library is primarily to support the World Magnetic Model (WMM) 2010-2015.
It however is built to be used for spherical harmonic models of the Earth's magnetic field
generally and supports models even with a large (>>12) number of degrees.  It is also used in the EMM.

REUSE NOTES

Geomagnetism Library is intended for reuse by any application that requires
Computation of Geomagnetic field from a spherical harmonic model.
