World Magnetic Model 2010 - Geomagnetism Library
================================================

This is the original NOAA Geomagnetism code compiled as a shared library
together with the command-line utilities and the WMM 2010 model (WMM.COF).
The technical documentation is not included and can be obtained with the
original WMM package:

  http://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/geomag/WMM/soft.shtml

The software re-configuration and the minimal necessary changes were done
by EOX IT Services, GmbH.

INSTALLATION
------------

Step 1 - configure:

  $ ./configure --prefix=/usr/ --libdir='${exec_prefix}/lib64'

For more detail see

  $ ./configure --help


Step 2 - build the binaries:

  $ make build


Step 3 - install the software:

  $ sudo make install


CLI USAGE
---------

The CLI tools, by default, behave identically like the original WMM CLI tools
and they expect the coefficients to be in file WMM.COF the current directory.

If the coefficient file is missing then an error is printed and the program is
gracefully terminated (unlike the original tools which ended with a
segmentation fault without any message printed.

The location of the coefficients can be changed by means of the WMM_COF
environment variable, e.g.,

  $ export WMM_COF=/usr/share/wmm/WMM.COF

In addition, the wmm_point.exe and wmm_grid.exe commands allow the coefficient
file to be specified as an optional command line argument:

  $ wmm_point.exe <wmm_cof_path>
  $ wmm_grid.exe <wmm_cof_path>
